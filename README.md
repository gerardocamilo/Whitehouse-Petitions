# Whitehouse-Petitions
The app allows you to see the most recent and top rated Whitehouse Petitions.

Created as a tutorial from the Hacking With Swift book.-

- Consumes Whitehouse Petitions API.
- Incorporates SwiftyJSON framework to handle the APIs response.
- Worked with Tab Bar Controller.
- Used master-detail scheme with Subtitle Prototype Cells, creating and displaying Detail controller by code.
- Used ViewController class for both Most Recent and Top Rated sections. This trick was made in: AppDelegate's didFinishLaunchingWithOptions function.
